# Healthcare Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to extract meaningful insights related to patient demographics, treatment costs, satisfaction levels, and follow-up behavior. The analysis integrates **SQL** and **Python** to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, supporting data-driven decision-making in healthcare management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patient demographics and visit patterns  
- Identify high-cost treatments and departments  
- Evaluate patient satisfaction across diagnoses  
- Understand follow-up behavior after treatment  
- Provide insights to improve healthcare planning and cost optimization  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **SQL Server**
- **PyODBC**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Import
- Healthcare dataset uploaded to **SQL Server**
- Connected SQL Server with **Jupyter Notebook** using **PyODBC**
- Data loaded into Pandas DataFrame using SQL queries

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled incorrect data types
- Converted visit date column into proper datetime format
- Checked for duplicates and null values

### 3️⃣ Data Analysis
Performed analysis using **SQL queries and Pandas**, including:
- Unique patient count
- Average age of patients
- Satisfaction score range by diagnosis
- Follow-up percentage after treatment
- Top 5 most expensive treatments
- Patient count by gender

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization
Created visualizations to support insights:
- Average treatment cost by department
- Proportion of patient visits by city
- City with the highest average treatment cost
- Diagnosis distribution by department
- Number of visits by age decade

### 5️⃣ Insights & Interpretation
- Derived business insights based on analysis results
- Identified key trends in patient behavior and costs

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Cardiology recorded the highest number of patients and treatment costs  
- Age group **30–39 years** showed the highest number of visits  
- Female patients had slightly higher satisfaction scores  
- Nearly **70% of patients did not return for follow-up visits**  
- Older patients generally incurred higher treatment costs  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **SQL and Python can be effectively integrated** to perform comprehensive healthcare data analysis. The insights generated can assist hospital management in improving patient care, optimizing costs, and enhancing follow-up strategies.
